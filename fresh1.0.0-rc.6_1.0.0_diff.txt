 The next-gen web framework.
 
-Fresh is a web framework that lets you build projects very fast, highly dynamic,
-and without the need of a build step. Fresh embraces isomorphic JavaScript like
-never before. Write a JSX component, have it render on the edge just-in-time,
-and then enhance it with client side JS for great interactivity.
-
-Fresh does not have a build step - you write your code, deploy it to
-[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy), and from there everything is handled by
-the framework.
-
-- No build step
-- Zero config necessary
-- JIT rendering on the edge
-- Tiny (example is 0-3KB of runtime JS)<sup>1</sup>
-- Optional client side hydration
-- TypeScript out of the box
+Fresh is a next generation web framework, built for speed, reliability, and
+simplicity. Some stand out features:
+
+- Just-in-time rendering on the edge.
+- Island based client hydration for maximum interactivity.
+- Zero runtime overhead: no JS is shipped to the client by default.
+- No build step.
+- No configuration necessary.
+- TypeScript support out of the box.
 - File-system routing à la Next.js

+  Data fetching in Fresh happens inside of route handler functions. These can pass route data to the page via page props.
+---
+
+Server side data fetching in Fresh is acomplished through asynchronous
+[handler functions][route-handlers]. These handler functions can call a
+`ctx.render()` function with the data to be rendered as an argument. This data
+can then be retreived by the page component through the `data` property on the
+`props`.
+
+Here is an example:
+
+```tsx
+interface Project {
+  name: string;
+  stars: number;
+}
+
+export const handler: Handlers<Project> = {
+  async GET(_req, ctx) {
+    const project = await db.projects.findOne({ id: ctx.params.id });
+    if (!project) {
+      return new Response("Project not found", { status: 404 });
+    }
+    return ctx.render(project);
+  },
+};
+
+export default function ProjectPage(props: PageProps<Project>) {
+  return (
+    <div>
+      <h1>{props.data.name}</h1>
+      <p>{props.data.stars} stars</p>
+    </div>
+  );
+}
+```
+
+The type parameter on the `PageProps`, `Handlers`, `Handler`, and
+`HandlerContext` can be used to enforce a TypeScript type to use for the render
+data. Fresh enforces during type checking that the types in all of these fields
+are compatible within a single page.

+  Error pages can be used to customize the page that is shown when an error occurs in the application.

+
+Fresh supports customizing the `404 Not Found`, and the
+`500 Internal Server Error` pages. These are shown when a request is made but no
+matching route exists, and when a middelware, route handler, or page component
+throws an error respectively.
+
+The 404 page can be customized by creating a `_404.tsx` file in the `routes/`
+folder. The file must have a default export that is a regular Preact component.
+A props object of type `UnknownPageProps` is passed in as an argument.
+
+```tsx

+export default function NotFoundPage({ url }: UnknownPageProps) {

+}

+---
+
+Islands enable client side interactivity in Fresh. Islands are isolated Preact
+components that are are rendered on the client. This is different from all other
+components in Fresh, as they are ususally just rendered on the server.
+
+Islands are defined by creating a file in the `islands/` folder in a Fresh
+project. The name of this file must be a PascalCase name of the island. The file
+must have a default export that is a regular preact component.
+
+```tsx
+// islands/MyIsland.tsx
+
+/** @jsx h */
+import { h } from "preact";
+import { useState } from "preact/hooks";
+
+export default function MyIsland() {
+  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
+
+  return (
+    <div>
+      Counter is at {count}.{" "}
+      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
+    </div>
+  );
+}
+```
+
+An island can be used in a page like a regular Preact component. Fresh will take
+care of automatically re-hydrating the island on the client.
+
+Passing props to islands is supported, but only if the props are JSON
+serializable. This means that you can only pass primitive types, plain objects,
+and arrays. It is currently not possible to pass complex objects like `Date`,
+custom classes, or functions. This means that it is not possible to pass
+`children` to an island, as `children` are VNodes, which are not serializable.
+
+It is also not supported to nest islands within other islands.
